# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis-Python

### Objectives:
•	Identify data patterns in Churn Customer through meaningful features<br/>
•	Find out the most suitable machine learning model to predict the key factors of churn and non churn customers
•	Any interesting findings during the analysis

### Data Information:
•	Dataset: CSV file<br/>
•	Data overview: 7043 rows(customers) and 21 columns(features)<br/>
•	Dependent Variable: Churn Column(Customers who left or no)<br/>
•	Demographic Variables: gender, age range, whether they have partners and dependents<br/>
•	Account Variables: how long they’ve been a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly and total charges<br/>
•	Sign-Up Services: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

### Data Preprocessing:
•Preprocessed data by plotting, removing duplicates, handling missing values, to prepare high-quality, reliable data for analysis

### Data Visualization:

### Feature Engineering:

### Modeling:
4 models were considered during this step<br/>
•	Logistic Regression<br/>
• Random Forest<br/>
• Decision Tree <br/>
• XG Boost

### Evaluation:
•	4 Metrics including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy<br/>
•	Confusion Matrix<br/>
•	ROC Curve<br/>
•	ROC_AUC Score


### Model Tuning and Results:
•	Optimized hyperparameters through Random Search and Grid Search techniques to increase model performance, which ultimately achieved 91% accuracy and 85% recall  

### Conlusions:
